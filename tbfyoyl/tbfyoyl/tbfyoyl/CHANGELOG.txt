I though it would be a good idea to have a changelog so that we could document
our changes to the code in detail without having to fatten up our commit
messages too much.

My changes include adding a dictionary to keep track of the minigames, and
changing a couple of the data members to private. The one major change I made
was wrapping activeGame up in an accessor, ActiveGame, so that one has to 
change activeGame only through the string name of that game.
